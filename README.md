# Rohan's Homelab

This repository contains my personal homelab deployment configurations, automation scripts, and infrastructure documentation. My goal is to maintain a version-controlled, reproducible setup for self-hosted services.

These Docker Compose stacks are for a Headless Linux Server OS running Docker.

> [!WARNING]
> These configurations are tailored to my network and infrastructure. You will need to modify them for your own environment.
